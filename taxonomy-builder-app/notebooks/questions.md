few questions i just want to jot down

1. do we put all of our permanent main code in the cool-library3 folder ( the one with init.py). Do we store the database there too?
   if so, we won't be keeping our permanent frontend code in demos

2. when i tried to pip install aylien_model_serving from serving.py, I got told there was 'No matching distribution found for aylien_model_serving'. Could you try this on your machine? It was the same error messages on powershell and kali linux for me
