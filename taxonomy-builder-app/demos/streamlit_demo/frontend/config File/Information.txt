Needed to change theme of app
Also need to have streamlit installed. 
I used https://docs.streamlit.io/get-started/installation/command-line

Follow Xiyuan's setup instructions to get the app running

Go to C:\Users\userName\.streamlit

1. If config.toml is present
Copy and paste contents of .toml file provided

2. If config.toml isn't present
Create a config.toml file, then paste contents of .toml file provided
NOTE: I created a text document, changed the extention on Windows
	Instead of having config.txt, I wrote config.toml
	May issue a warning that changing the extention may lead to the file being unusable, ignore this and click yes

	!! Check that the file extention is a .toml file !!

Temporary until we can find a way to change the colour of individual elements
